Hello La Trobe Students,

The La Trobe Robotics Club will be running again in semester 2, and we are planning to have an AGM with free pizza in about a week to celebrate. If you wish to attend please fill out your availability here: https://www.when2meet.com/?30659292-lbjEb

We will choose the best suited time on Sunday and announce an event.
